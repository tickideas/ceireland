# Church Portal Banner Design Guidelines

## Banner Dimensions & Specifications

### Recommended Banner Dimensions

#### **Primary Recommendation: 1200x450px (24:9 aspect ratio)**
- **Desktop Display**: Full width with optimal text visibility
- **Mobile Display**: Maintains readable text and graphics
- **File Format**: PNG or JPEG
- **File Size**: Keep under 500KB for fast loading

#### **Alternative Dimensions (in order of preference):**
1. **1050x450px (21:9 aspect ratio)** - Good for desktop, very good for tablets
2. **960x540px (16:9 aspect ratio)** - Good for mobile, acceptable for desktop

### Responsive Behavior
- **Mobile (up to 768px)**: Banner displays at 16:9 aspect ratio
- **Tablet (768px - 1024px)**: Banner displays at 21:9 aspect ratio  
- **Desktop (1024px+)**: Banner displays at 24:9 aspect ratio

## Design Guidelines

### Text Placement & Readability
- **Safe Zone**: Keep all important text and logos within the center 80% of the banner
- **Text Size**: Use large, bold fonts (minimum 24px equivalent when scaled)
- **Contrast**: Ensure high contrast between text and background
- **Text Position**: Center or slightly upper-center positioning works best

### Visual Composition
- **Focus Point**: Place main subject/message in the center of the banner
- **Background**: Can extend to full width, but key elements should be centered
- **Margins**: Leave at least 5% margin from edges for critical content

### Color & Branding
- **Brand Consistency**: Use church brand colors and fonts
- **Readability**: Ensure text is readable on all device sizes
- **Contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for accessibility

## Technical Specifications

### File Requirements
- **Format**: PNG (for text/graphics) or JPEG (for photos)
- **Resolution**: 72-96 DPI (web optimized)
- **Color Space**: sRGB
- **Maximum File Size**: 500KB (recommended), 1MB (maximum)

### Optimization Tips
- **Compress images** using tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim
- **Use appropriate format**: PNG for graphics with text, JPEG for photographic content
- **Test on mobile** to ensure text remains readable at smaller sizes

## Banner Content Best Practices

### Text Content
- **Headline**: Maximum 6-8 words for mobile readability
- **Subtext**: Keep secondary information minimal
- **Call-to-Action**: Make buttons/links clearly visible

### Visual Elements
- **Logo Placement**: Upper left or center, ensure it's clearly visible
